### INSTALLATION
Prerequisites include [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp).

Additionally, the site, even if ran locally, requires the [remote host](http://pupper.papupa.com/) to be reachable. If this is not the case for you, please reach out to us.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/7gang/puppermatch/`, followed by `cd puppermatch`.
2. Install NPM dependencies with `npm i`.
3. Run the application in "developer mode" with `npm run watch` to enable "hot reload" when the underlying source code changes.
4. Go to `http://localhost/` in your browser of choice.
